\title{Topic Modeling Over Time\\\medskip An Annotated Bibliography}
\author{Michael Bean (Bean.Michael@byu.net)\\Brigham Young University}
\maketitle

Below is an annotated bibliography. For the most part, I was able to use the abstract to get a notion for the problems, solutions, and effectiveness thereof in solving the problems. I annotate the papers for not only what is in them, but also provide a critique when possible. I strive to keep these succinct and preserve the author's description where possible.

I believe the two published works, \cite{hall-jurafsky-manning:2008:EMNLP} and \cite{Krstovski2013efficient}, are particularly of salient as pertaining to my work.
